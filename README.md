This is a filter list for the fantastic [uBlacklist](https://ublacklist.github.io/) browser plugin.

I'm trying to remove watermarked garbage from my image search results, which means blocking most stock image sites.

PRs welcome. Getty seem to have ten million domains. You can easily find likely candidates by searching "{race} {gender} smiling". On searches like this, uBlacklist eventually stops working due to blocking 95% of results.

One unfortunate side effect of using this list is that AI garbage becomes more prominent. This bug could be a feature to maintainers of AI blocklists.
